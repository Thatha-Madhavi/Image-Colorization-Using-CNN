# Image-Colourization

Convert black-and-white images into vibrant, realistic colour using deep-learning-powered image processing.

## 📸 Overview

**Automatic Image Colouring** is a deep-learning–based project that transforms grayscale images into natural-looking colour versions.
This notebook demonstrates:

- Converting B&W images to LAB colour space

- Passing the L-channel through a pretrained CNN model

- Predicting colour channels

- Recombining channels to form the final colourized output

- Everything runs inside a single Jupyter Notebook for clarity and simplicity.
