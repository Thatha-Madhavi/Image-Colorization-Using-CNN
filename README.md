# Image-Colourization

Convert black-and-white images into vibrant, realistic colour using deep-learning-powered image processing.

## 📸 Overview

**Automatic Image Colouring** is a deep-learning–based project that transforms grayscale images into natural-looking colour versions.
This notebook demonstrates:

- Converting B&W images to LAB colour space

- Passing the L-channel through a pretrained CNN model

- Predicting colour channels

- Recombining channels to form the final colourized output

- Everything runs inside a single Jupyter Notebook for clarity and simplicity.

## ✨ Features

🎨 Automatic B&W → Colour conversion

🤖 Powered by pretrained deep-learning models

🖼️ Works on any photo (portraits, landscapes, architecture)

📓 Clean and easy-to-run Jupyter Notebook

⚡ Realistic and high-quality output

## 🧠 How It Works

- Load grayscale image

- Extract L (lightness) channel

- Pass L through pretrained colourization model

- Predict AB colour channels

- Merge channels into LAB → Convert to RGB

- Display coloured results

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x

- OpenCV (cv2)

- NumPy

- Matplotlib

- Deep Learning Pretrained Models

- Jupyter Notebook
